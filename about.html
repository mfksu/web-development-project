            <p>Hello, my name is Michael Francis. I am a junior at KSU and I am majoring in IT. I love learning about new technology which is why I believe I am well suited for this major. I built my first computer at 14 years old and have been excited to learn more ever since.
                <br>
                <br>
                I began my academic journey at Chattahoochee Technical College earning an Associates in Networking. Since then I have transfered to KSU and began my studies here. <br>
                <br>
                 In my freetime I enjoy mountainbiking, reading, and playing guitar.
                I began playing guitar during the pandemic and while I am not a great player I am proud of my progress.
